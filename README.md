This is a responsive (mobile/desktop) and light-weight HTML/CSS template for building projects or personal websites without using complex libraries, such as Bootstrap or jQuery UI. If you would love to keep updating this template, please avoid modifying the main.css file. Instead, please keep your own style in the index.css file.<br />
