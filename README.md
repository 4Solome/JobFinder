This is a responsive (mobile/desktop) and light-weight HTML/CSS template for building projects or personal websites. If your website does not require complex user interactions, you can use this template (index.html) without JavaScript libraries. For building interactive websites (widgets.html), you will need to include jQuery and jQuery UI. One example that uses this template is [Smell PGH](http://smellpgh.org). If you would love to keep updating this template, please keep your own style and script in index.css and index.js, avoid modifying the following files:
- frame.css (CSS for the main frame of the website)
- controls.css (CSS for control elements that do not require JavaScript)
- widgets.css (CSS for widgets that require JavaScript)
- widgets.js (JavaScript for widgets)

This template is tested and worked on:
- Desktop/Mobile Chrome 69.0.3497.100
- Desktop/Mobile Firefox 62.0.3
- Desktop Safari 11.1.2
